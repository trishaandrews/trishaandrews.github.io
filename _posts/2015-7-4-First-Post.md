Happy Independence Day! I just finished my first week of Metis, and decided to take a break from debugging the first project and start this blog. Metis is challenging, but fun, and I look forward to being able to post about Project Benson, which uses data from [MTA turnstiles](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html), in the next couple days.
